Multitasking ,Multithreading and Multiprocessing

Multitasking : The ability of an OS which handles or manages the different tasks , to execute multiple independent progras
or tasks concurrently , where tasks are switching so instantly between each other (time-sharing the CPU in OS) . Each task
has its own seperate memory space. 

for eg: Running  web browser , word application , music player on a single - core processor or computer . The OS will allocate
 small time slices to each application , creating the virtual environment or illusion that all are running parallely 
 
Multithreading : A technique where a single program or process is dividied into multiple independent units of execution called 
Thread

for eg :  A web server handling multiple client request  concurrently , Instead of creating a new process for each request
(would be  proper resource allocation ) , the server creates a new thread for each client request , sharing the server's resources 
(asynchronous manner) 

Synchronous --- When one thread will execute completely then only the another thread or a process will execute , no matter how 
how much time the first thread is taking to complete. for eg: Read / Write , Withdraw  / Deposit 

Asynchronous --- When multiple thread or process can execute concurrently or parallely to utilize the waiting time for a thread which 
is time consuming process : --  for eg: Order/(Notification/Alerts) parallely they are receiving  ,,
File copying ( while copying // some percentage  it shows that how much time is left or done) 

class Program
{

void input()
{}

void display()
{}

static void main(String[] args) -- thread
{
    input()  --- thread
    display() --- thread
}

}

Thread is light in process ( weight)
Better Peformance , Optimization 
Thread communication

Multiprocessing :   the use of multiple independent processing units( Multiple processors / CPU cores)  within a single computer
system to execute multiple processes or programs simultaneously in parallel where each process runs on a seperate processor

Gaming software , video editing software ( audio / video / animation) the process takes place and has its own dedicated memory space .

Different parts of the video related tasks can be distributed among the available cores , which leads to faster completion
